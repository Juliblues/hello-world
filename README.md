# hello-world
This is my first time using GitHub, woooohooo. I´m trying to learn basic stuff and I´m absolutely thrilled about it &lt;3
I love coding , beach and having ramen soup in winter time (actually, I love ramen in any time). 
And of course, I absolutely love my little sister Gigi, who encouraged me to take up coding.
